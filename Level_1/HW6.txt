Dictionary Analytics
Let's pick a word file using the following command in the terminal:

We get http://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.100000
This contains all the words in the English dictionary. (Or a lot of them at least.)

Write a function that returns the exact number of words in the file.
If the file is empty, print ‘No words found’. Otherwise, print the number of words found.

Print the letter with which most words begin.

Extending the previous exercise, find the letter with which maximum words begin.

First find the number of words starting with 'a'.

Create a dictionary using for loop, read the file one line at a time.
If a word beginning with 'a' is found, then add an item to the dictionary with 'a' as the key and 1 as the value.

If 'a' already exists in the dictionary, then increase its value.Print the dictionary.

When the loop ends, the dictionary should contain the number of words starting with 'a'.

Apply the same concept to get a dictionary with letters as the keys and the number of words as the values.Now you can tell with which letter most words begin.

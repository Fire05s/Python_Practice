Functions can be stored and imported as a module

Create functions to calculate the area of a rectangle, triangle and circle.
Write a program that asks the user the shape (rectangle, triangle or circle) for which one wishes to calculate the area.
Based on the user's choice, call the appropriate function.

(Each function must take inputs of the required information. Create a new file called area_functions.py. Move the function definitions from the main program to the new file. Import these functions into the main program such that the behavior of the program does not change.)
